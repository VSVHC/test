Tests for HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities.

Attack: Injects CRLF sequences into user-controlled values that get
        reflected in response headers (e.g. redirect Location, Set-Cookie).
        A successful injection lets the attacker craft a fake HTTP response
        — enabling XSS, cache poisoning, and session fixation.

Payloads (CRLF injected via common redirect/return parameters):
  %0d%0aSet-Cookie:test=1             → inject a Set-Cookie header
  %0d%0aLocation:https://example.com  → inject a Location header

Detection (STRICT — real splits only, no reflection):
  A payload is vulnerable ONLY when the split actually happened at the HTTP
  layer, proven by the injected HEADER appearing as a real response header
  with the expected value (Set-Cookie:test=1, Location:https://example.com).
  Explicitly NOT flagged:
    - HTTP 400 (server rejected the CRLF — defended correctly)
    - the payload merely reflected inside an HTML/JSON body
    - the payload returned encoded / as plain text

Katana integration:
  Iterates ALL URLs discovered by Katana instead of only testing /.
  Stops at first confirmed vulnerable URL.
