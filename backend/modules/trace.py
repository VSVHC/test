"""
modules/trace.py
─────────────────
Checks if HTTP TRACE method is enabled on the server.

Rule:
  Sends TRACE to each discovered URL.
  Vulnerable ONLY if the server returns HTTP 200 AND the response body
  actually contains proof of an echo (the unique probe header value, or
  the request line starting with "TRACE"). A bare 200 alone is not
  trusted — SPA catch-all / soft-404 routing (see crawl_pipeline.py's
  soft-404 detection) can return 200 with the normal app shell for
  almost any method or path, which previously would have been
  misread as XST-vulnerable with no supporting evidence at all.
  Severity: LOW (as specified)

Attack: Cross-Site Tracing (XST) — steal cookies/auth tokens
        even when HttpOnly flag is set.

Katana integration:
  Iterates ALL URLs discovered by Katana instead of only testing /.
  Stops at first confirmed hit (one TRACE finding per scan is sufficient).
